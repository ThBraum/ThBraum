### About me :thought_balloon: 

Hi. My name is Matheus Thomaz Braum, but you can just call me Braum. 

I am 22 years old, graduated in Information Systems from Unicamp, currently studying postgraduate studies in Software Engineering. 
I have always been passionate about technology and innovation. I love to learn and I’m very dedicated, with dedication being one of my differentials.

<!-- I'm currently improving my skills in C#, C++ and Java, as well as learning other languages. -->
