### About me

Hi. My name is Matheus Thomaz Braum, but you can just call me Braum. 

I’m an 19 year old student of Information Systems at Unicamp. I always have been passionate about technology
and innovation. I love to learn and I’m very dedicated, with dedication being one of my differentials. 

I'm currently improving my C++ skills and learning Java.
