### About me :thought_balloon: 

Hi. My name is Matheus Thomaz Braum, but you can just call me Braum. 

I am 23 years old, graduated in Information Systems from Unicamp, and hold a postgraduate degree in Software Engineering.
I have always been passionate about technology and innovation. I’m a fast and curious learner, constantly seeking to improve and expand my knowledge.
One of my strongest qualities is my dedication - I always give my best in every task and stay focused on delivering high-quality results.

<!-- I'm currently improving my skills in C#, C++ and Java, as well as learning other languages. -->
